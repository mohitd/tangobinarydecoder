# Tango Binary Decoder
Using a fork of the [MeshBuilder](https://github.com/mohitd/tango-examples-unity) application, it is possible to save data externally to access it at:

`/sdcard/Android/data/com.projecttango.experiments.unitymeshbuilder/files`.

This data is written in a binary format, however. This project decodes the binary file back into plaintext.
